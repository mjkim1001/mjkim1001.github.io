title: Learning PDEs via NN (2024-)
categories: [Research]

Leveraging connections from my 2022 internship, I initiated a 2024 project focusing on my second research interest: using Neural Networks for data-driven approaches to solve PDEs, specifically based on implicit neural representations. This work involves modeling latent state dynamics to solve parametric PDEs, contributing to the field of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for reduced-order modeling.
