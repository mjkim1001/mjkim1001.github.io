Another area of my research focuses on using neural networks for both data-driven and/or physics-based approaches to solve PDEs, leveraging implicit neural representations. This work involves modeling latent state dynamics to solve parametric PDEs, contributing to the field of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for reduced-order modeling.
