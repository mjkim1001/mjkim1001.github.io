Another area of my research focuses on using neural networks for both data-driven and/or physics-based approaches to solve PDEs. This work involves modeling latent state dynamics to solve parametric PDEs, contributing to the field of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for reduced-order modeling.

### Latent Space Modeling and Dynamics

We project the high-dimensional states $u(t) \in \mathbb{R}^N$ of a PDE into a lower-dimensional latent space $z(t) \in \mathbb{R}^r$ (with $r \ll N $) using an encoder. 
The evolution of these latent variables is then modeled using a neural network:

$$
\frac{dz(t)}{dt} = f_\theta(z(t), t; \mu)
$$

where $ \mu $ represents problem parameters. The latent state dynamics are decoded back to the original space using a decoder $ D_\phi $ to approximate the solution.
