This section introduces topics I explored in Advanced Machine Learning.

* Study on generative diffusion models (for Advanced Machine Learning class project, fall 2023) - [Diffusion Model](../assets/documents/paper-diffusion.pdf)

* Talk on learning spatio-temporal solutions to PDEs (for High-Dimensional Time-Series class talk, spring 2024) - [HDTS talk](../assets/documents/talk24-HDTS.pdf)

* Addressing distribution shift in real-time bidding markets (2023 Summer internship project) - [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07424)

* [Poster](../assets/documents/poster21-csp.pdf) on spatio-temporal analysis of particulate matter data based on the quantile factor model (presented at CSP 2021 conference)
