My research focuses on leveraging multiple computer models with varying levels of fidelity (in terms of accuracy and cost) to achieve more accurate estimations, a field known as multi-fidelity (MF) modeling. 
According to Peherstorfer et al. (2018) MF strategies can be categorized into three types as follows:

1. **Adaptation**: High-fidelity information is used to enhance the lower-fidelity model.
2. **Filtering**: The low-fidelity model is explored to determine where to evaluate the high-fidelity model.
3. **Fusion**: This involves the combined use of multiple models.

### My Contributions

The application of our interest concerns modeling ship motions (and especially their extremes) in the field of Naval Architecture. I have conducted a series of studies in this area, and my research can be categorized as follows:

- **MF Calibration**: This research of adaptation type focused on improving the low-fidelity output by leveraging high-fidelity output.
- **MF Importance Sampling**: This study tackled the problem of estimating the probability density function (p.d.f) of high-fidelity values based on a kernel-based importance sampling estimator, a problem that combines filtering and fusion strategies.
- **MFMC**: This research focuses on constructing a fusion-type estimator. Under the assumption of a parametric distribution, three multi-fidelity parameter estimation methods are considered and compared.
