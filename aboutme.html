            Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics and Operations Research (STOR) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
            
            My advisor is Prof. Vladas Pipiras, and we are working on sampling and calibration of multi-fidelity models.

            My Ph.D. work is to bring the perception of the data visualization to the automation of the visualization design. I'm interested in the algorithms / models / systems for automatic visualization desgins, and perception studies across single / multiple / sequences of statistical graphics.

            I received my B.S. (2019) and M.S. (2021) in Statistics at Seoul National University under the supervision of Prof. Hee-Seok Oh. I worked at LLNL and Moloco as a summer intenship. More details in my CV.
